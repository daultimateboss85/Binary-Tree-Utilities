# Binary Tree Utilities

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description: Group of functions that help when working with binary trees

### Background To project

Binary Tree Utilities was a project inspired by me solving some binary tree problems. I realised i will be able to understand the problems better if i could somehow visualise the tree. This led me to try creating a function whose purpose was to print out a binary tree.
In my quest to do so, i created several functions relating to binary trees, and as such Binary Tree Utilitites was born.

### Main Features

- #### Get maximum depth of tree

  This function allows to get the maximum depth of a tree.
  Returns a tuple with item at first index being a leaf node with maximum depth and item at second index being an integer representing maximum depth of tree

- #### Get nodes in tree by level

  Supplying a level and this function returns all nodes on that level of the tee

- #### Invert tree

  Given the root node to a binary tree, this function inverts the tree

- #### Print tree
  Given the root node to a binary tree, this function prints the tree such that it is easy to see all nodes in the tree
